# Hi, I'm Majd Mallouk 👋

I'm a Laravel developer who loves building all kinds of projects—whether it's a sleek web app, a complex backend, or something experimental just for fun.

### 🚀 Featured Project
- **[Wallety](https://wallety.rf.gd/public/)** – An __open-source__ full-stack platform to manage your finances (kinda like Paypal) built from the ground, It's a user-friendly platform for seamless money transfers, deposits, and currency exchange. Users can send and receive funds using usernames or emails, and enjoy QR code scanning and generation for quick transactions.
